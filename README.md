# Real-Time Next-Word Prediction for Low-Resource Languages
Overview
This project focuses on next-word prediction for low-resource languages, specifically targeting Hinglish (Hindi-English code-mixed) datasets. The goal is to create a robust solution for predicting the next word in real-time, tailored to handle the challenges posed by multilingual and code-mixed text.

Low-resource languages often lack extensive datasets, making traditional NLP approaches less effective. This project provides a scalable and efficient framework for enhancing text prediction capabilities for such languages.
